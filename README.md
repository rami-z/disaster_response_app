# Disaster Response Web App

## Project Overview
This repository contains code for a web app which an emergency worker could use during a disaster event (e.g. an earthquake or hurricane), to classify a disaster message into several categories, in order that the message can be directed to the appropriate aid agencies. 

The app uses a ML model to categorize any new messages received, and the repository also contains the code used to train the model and to prepare any new datasets for model training purposes.

## Running Instructions
1. Enter the app folder in Terminal.
2. Run the following command in the app directory:
    `python run.py`
3. Open any Browsers for example 'Google Chrome'.
3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
